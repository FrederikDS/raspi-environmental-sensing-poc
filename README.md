# Office Environmental Sensing - Device POC

## Goal

* Build a proof of concept device that is able to measure environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, light, air quality and sound level.
* Sensor data is forwarded to an IoT cloud service that will aggregate and stores the data. Data will be available through REST API or MQTT. 


## Challenge
* Build the device with a Raspi Zero W & Grove sensors
* Use NodeJS as programming language
* Use MQTT to transmit the sensor data to the AllThingsTalk IoT Maker Platform
